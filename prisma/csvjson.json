    "description": "This project is very complicated. Step 1. either one or two teams each build a “mouse” - a small robot that has wheels to move it as fast as possible, and sensors so it knows where it is. Step 2. After discussing what a search algorithm is, we can try to implement one on the Arduino. This shows the mouse how it can move through a maze. The problem is, we need a maze. Step 3. Construct a maze from wood which is just large enough for the mice to turn and move.\n\n\nThis project will probably have to happen later in the summer if at all. I listed 2 days as the duration, but this is counting one day of building and one day of programming/explaining how that stuff works, and I’m not sure how or when we would build the maze.",

Each tile serves a different purpose in the game and they can be shuffled around and stacked in different ways to make the game unique each time it’s played. It’s a long project because it involves cutting wood, painting, and brainstorming how the game is going to work.

The slogan. This is a one sentence explanation of what the team is going to do if they win the election.\n3. Hacker camp political opinions. Which doctor in Dr. Who is the best? Do we really need another lathe? The teams need to decide on their opinion on some of them. We gave about 10 examples to start from, and they had lots more.\n4. The poster. This needs to be planned and has the name of the team, their slogan, and some artwork from what they are trying to do, like popcorn for the team who want to have us eat popcorn at movie nights.\n5. The video. The campers decide on a filming plan for their video which might include an interview or showcase of what the team is planning on doing if everyone votes for them. They can also be edited if there’s enough time.\n\nLastly, at synthesis the videos are shown and all of camp votes on whichever team they like the most.\n\n\nHere are some of the “political” opinions I thought of to get them started:\nShould we eat strawberry pizza at camp?\nDo we need another lathe?\nShould we eat lunch inside or outside?\nIs a movie night better or is game night better?\nWhich is the best room in camp?\nAre hexagons really the bestagons?\nCampers can also suggest more",
