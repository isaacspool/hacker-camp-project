        "description": "This is an activity I already ran this year, but it’s worth recording what we did.\nWe split into groups of 4-5, although we should’ve kept the max at 4 per group. Each group creates 5 things.\n1. The team name. This can be something from geek culture, hacker camp culture, or whatever. This year we had “The Lathe Rebellion”, “NGGYU”, and “Demopracy”\n2. The slogan. This is a one sentence explanation of what the team is going to do if they win the election.\n3. Hacker camp political opinions. Which doctor in Dr. Who is the best? Do we really need another lathe? The teams need to decide on their opinion on some of them. We gave about 10 examples to start from, and they had lots more.\n4. The poster. This needs to be planned and has the name of the team, their slogan, and some artwork from what they are trying to do, like popcorn for the team who want to have us eat popcorn at movie nights.\n5. The video. The campers decide on a filming plan for their video which might include an interview or showcase of what the team is planning on doing if everyone votes for them. They can also be edited if there’s enough time.\n\nLastly, at synthesis the videos are shown and all of camp votes on whichever team they like the most.\n\n\nHere are some of the “political” opinions I thought of to get them started:\nShould we eat strawberry pizza at camp?\nDo we need another lathe?\nShould we eat lunch inside or outside?\nIs a movie night better or is game night better?\nWhich is the best room in camp?\nAre hexagons really the bestagons?\nCampers can also suggest more",

        "description": "Invent the game that Adam and the Think Higher team wanted to make, but thought was too complicated (to prove them wrong, and also bestagons). The essence of the idea is to create a 3D board game that’s dynamic, meaning the board can look different each game. This would involve using the bestagon device to cut wooden hexagons to use in the game. Each tile serves a different purpose in the game and they can be shuffled around and stacked in different ways to make the game unique each time it’s played. It’s a long project because it involves cutting wood, painting, and brainstorming how the game is going to work. It can’t be too complicated, but it needs to have some element of skill, not just luck, although some luck is good too.\n\n\nThe game they made in Think Higher is super cool!",

How can we make sure players don’t get board if it’s not their turn? How can we include players with disabilities such as color blindness or dyslexia (separate by icons vs. colors or text)?",

Then, I'll explain some of the way it's coded and why certain functions make it work. The campers can even try and code a bit of the algorithm themselves, although it is very complicated.\nThe second half of the day is about the other meaning of \"Wave Function Collapse\" which comes from quantum mechanics. It explains how quantum particles can be in many different states all at the same time, but \"collapse\" as soon as we inspect them. With this, I'll explain how to make requests to run code on real quantum computers using Python and Qiskit (https://qiskit.org/).\n\n\nNote that this activity requires explaining and sitting around for a while, which is to be expected on computer activities",
