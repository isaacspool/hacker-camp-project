        Kids will have a working version of Catan
        Kids will make minor design adaptations together
        Kids will learn how the game itself is used, so they can make the above decisions
        and also. .  . so we can create our own הרכבה(expantion) (with . . . dragons?  tanks? Daleks? ships? TUNNELS?  Goblins?  etc.)`,
